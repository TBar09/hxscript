"""Collate the per-library benchmark lines into ONE per-case list plus compact summaries.

Deliberately one table of record. An earlier version printed the whole corpus once per scale, plus
totals, plus averages, plus a chart for each, which came to eighteen tables and eighteen charts saying
a handful of things repeatedly, which is a lot to keep consistent by hand when a single number changes. What
comes out now is one list at a reference scale, a summary, and the evidence that the ranking does not
depend on the scale. Everything else was restatement.

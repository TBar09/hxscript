#   SCALE=200000 sh test/bench/hlbench/run.sh
#
# Four columns, from two builds:
#
#   hashlink/vm      the corpus as Haxe, compiled to `.hl`, run by the HashLink VM
#   hashlink/c       the same Haxe, compiled to C and linked as a native binary
#   hxscript hl/c    the corpus as scripts, compiled to HashLink bytecode at run time
#   hxscript interp  the same scripts, walked as a tree
#
# Three of the four come out of the HL/C binary, so the compiled Haxe and the scripts are measured in
# one process by one clock. Only the VM column is a second build, since running on the VM is the
# thing it measures.
#
# The corpus is `test/bench/mbench/ModeCases.hx`, the same one the execution-mode benchmark uses.
# A natively compiled case cannot take its loop count at run time, so `GenNative` writes the Haxe
# half at a fixed scale and the harness refuses to run at any other. Change SCALE and both halves
# are regenerated together.

# those into `R:\...` in command ARGUMENTS, which is why every `-cp` here works, but it does not
# touch the environment. So the generator resolved `/r/...` against the current drive and wrote the

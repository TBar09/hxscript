/**
 * Generates one bridge per base scripts may extend, which is `Autowire`'s bridging step.
 *
 * **A bridge is the only way a script can extend something the host compiled**, and the reason is
 * not a limitation of this library: a native base's methods can only be overridden by a subclass
 * that existed when the host was built, and a script does not exist then. The bridge is that
 * subclass, generated ahead of time, overriding what the base offers and forwarding into the
 * interpreter. So "any class can be extended" means "any class you bridged", and what follows is the
 * three ways of deciding which.
 *
 * - by default, the curated `bases` list of each active library, which is small and costs little;
 * - `-D hxscript_bridge_types=StringBuf,game.Actor`, exactly those classes;
 * - `-D hxscript_bridge_packages=flixel,openfl.display`, every eligible class under those roots;
 * - `-D hxscript_bridge_all`, every eligible class under every active library's roots.
 *
 * The last two are compile-time decisions about binary size, and they are not free: a bridge carries
 * one generated override per inherited non-`inline`, non-`final` method. `-D hxscript_verbose`
 * reports what was bridged and what was passed over, so the cost and the coverage are both visible
 * rather than guessed at.

	 *
	 * A `final` class cannot be bridged at all, which is occasionally the right trade: keeping a
	 * hot-path class `final` lets hxcpp devirtualise calls to it.
	 *
	 * **Nothing is generated for a display request.** A bridge re-emits its base's constructor,
	 * which means reading that constructor back with `Context.getTypedExpr`, and a display
	 * compile does not type a function body it was not asked about: what comes back is not an
	 * expression and the request dies with `Invalid expression`. The editor shows a hover
	 * loading and then nothing, which reads as the library breaking completion rather than as
	 * one macro that cannot run in this mode. Skipping costs completion nothing, because a

	 * host writes against, and it takes the request from seventeen seconds to under two.

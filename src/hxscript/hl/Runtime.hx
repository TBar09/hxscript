/**
 * What compiled code calls for the things it cannot say in instructions.
 *
 * A module HashLink loads gets its own type table, so a `String` or an `Array` built inside one
 * would not be the host's and could not be handed back. Everything that is not a number, a boolean
 * or a class of the batch is therefore a host value held in a `Dynamic`, and most of what a script
 * does to one is an instruction already: `ODynGet` reads a field, `OCallClosure` calls a method.
 *
 * This is the remainder. Each entry is bound into a global the same way a host static is, so
 * reaching one costs a global read and a call rather than anything the emitter has to arrange.
 *
 * The semantics are the interpreter's, deliberately: an operator has to mean the same thing
 * whichever of the two ran it, and the interpreter is where that meaning is already decided. Its
 * own helpers are instance methods on a hot class, so they are mirrored here rather than shared,
 * which keeps a widening of the compiler from moving the interpreter's code around.

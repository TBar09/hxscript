/**
 * flixel members that have no runtime form, re-registered as real closures (flixel 6.2.0).
 *
 * `FlxCamera`, `FlxFrame` and `AtlasBase` declare more of these. Only the ones a script is likely to
 * reach are shimmed: each is a closure somebody has to keep correct across upgrades, and an unused
 * shim keeps compiling long after the signature it emulates has moved.
 *
 * Every one of these is written against 6.2.0 and registers only there, which is what
 * `#if (flixel > "6.1.2")` says. Two of the three cannot be right before it. `clipToWorldRect` and
 * the `clipToWorldBounds` it calls do not exist at all in 6.1.2, so the shim does not compile; and
 * `playMusic` is an ordinary method there rather than an inline overload, so it already has a
 * runtime form, and shimming it would replace a working member with one that reads its arguments in
 * the order 6.2.0 introduced.

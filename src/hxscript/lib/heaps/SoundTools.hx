/**
 * Turns raw PCM a script generated into a playable sound, on heaps.
 *
 * The counterpart of `hxscript.lib.openfl.SoundTools`, and it takes the same arguments so a script that
 * generates its own audio moves between the two targets without changing what it hands over.
 *
 * heaps takes a sound from a resource rather than from a buffer, so the samples are wrapped in a
 * WAV: a 44-byte header and the data after it, which is what a WAV is. That is deliberate rather
 * than a detour. The alternative is reaching into `hxd.snd.Data` and providing a decoder, which
 * means owning a piece of heaps' internals for the life of the library, where the header is a fixed
 * format that has not changed since 1991 and that heaps already knows how to read.

# Macros, a custom interpreter, and binding your API

[embedding.md](embedding.md) covers getting scripts running. This covers what a host reaches for
once they are: **generating bridges** instead of writing them, **making native abstracts visible**
to scripts, **wiring in a game library** you do not own, **subclassing the interpreter**, and the
full set of **binding surfaces** for handing your API over.

Everything here is in [`../examples/battle/`](../examples/battle) and runs:

```
haxe -cp src -cp examples/battle -main Main \
  --macro include('bridges') --macro macros.BridgeMacro.generate() \
  --macro macros.AbstractsMacro.generate() --macro include('game') --interp
```

The same wiring in project form is [`../examples/battle/Project.xml`](../examples/battle/Project.xml).

---

## 1. Generating bridges

A script writes `class Slime extends Entity` only if a **bridge** exists: an empty class extending
`Entity` and implementing `hxscript.IScripted`, whose `@:autoBuild` generates an override of every
inherited method that dispatches to the script and falls through to `super`.

Written by hand that is one file per base ([`../examples/battle/bridges/ScriptedEntity.hx`](../examples/battle/bridges/ScriptedEntity.hx)),
which is clearer for one or two. Past that it is a folder of identical empty classes, each of which
has to be kept in the build by hand, so generate them:

```haxe
Context.defineModule('$PACK.$name', [{
	pack: pack,
	name: name,
	pos: pos,
	meta: [{name: ':keep', pos: pos}],
	kind: TDClass(superPath, [{pack: ['hxscript'], name: 'IScripted'}], false, false, false),
	fields: []
}]);
```

Full version: [`../examples/battle/macros/BridgeMacro.hx`](../examples/battle/macros/BridgeMacro.hx). Three details
in it are not obvious and all three are load-bearing.

**One module per bridge.** A type defined as a sub-type of another module can only be named through
that module, so putting them all in one makes every reference read
`bridges.Bridges.ScriptedFlxSprite`.

**Something has to reference them.** Bridges are only ever instantiated reflectively, so nothing in
the program refers to one and DCE removes them. Emit an array that does:

```haxe
kind: FVar(macro :Array<Class<Dynamic>>, {expr: EArrayDecl(refs), pos: pos})
```

`@:keep` alone is not enough if the module itself is never pulled in; pair it with an
`--macro include('bridges')` or a real reference like the array.

**Cost is per inherited method.** One generated override per non-inline, non-final inherited method.
A wide base is expensive, so bridge the classes scripts actually subclass rather than everything.

A `final` class cannot be bridged at all, and that is sometimes the right trade: keeping a class
`final` lets hxcpp devirtualise calls to it, which is worth more than scriptability on a type that
runs in a hot loop.

---

## 2. Making native abstracts visible

An abstract has **no runtime representation**. A script handed one sees nothing: no methods, no
operators, no `from`/`to`, and for an `enum abstract` none of its constants.
`hxscript.macro.Abstract` emits a reflectable wrapper that gives it one.

On an abstract you own, that is one line:

```haxe
@:build(hxscript.macro.Abstract.build())
abstract Damage(Int) from Int to Int { ... }
```

The abstracts a host actually wants scriptable are mostly in libraries it does not own, and those
cannot be annotated. Apply it from outside instead:

```haxe
Compiler.addMetadata('@:build(hxscript.macro.Abstract.build())', 'game.Damage');
```

[`../examples/battle/macros/AbstractsMacro.hx`](../examples/battle/macros/AbstractsMacro.hx) scans a package for
`abstract` declarations and applies it to each, so an abstract added to a library later is covered
without editing a list. A hand-maintained list gets discovered the hard way: a runtime
`Unknown identifier` from somebody's script, then a rebuild to add one line.

### Four things that will cost you an afternoon

**The type also has to be in the build.** Metadata on a type nothing compiled references does
nothing, because the type is never typed. The script then fails with `Type not found: game.Damage`,
which does not point anywhere near the cause. Pair the macro with an include of the same package:

```
--macro macros.AbstractsMacro.generate() --macro include('game')
```

**An `inline` member stays invisible.** Inlining is a compile-time substitution, so there is no
method for the wrapper to expose and the call fails with `Cannot call null`. This bites hardest on
abstracts, where `inline` is the house style, and it applies whichever way the macro was applied. A
member a script has to reach cannot be `inline`. (Flixel turning `FlxG.sound.playMusic` into an
`inline extern` overload is the same failure one level up; see `callShims` below.)

**A package-wide filter is not an option.** Two shapes break the generator, and it does not degrade
on them, it fails the build: an `enum abstract` with a value-less constructor (`var Red;` with no
`= 0`), and an abstract whose members call each other unqualified. Scan and skip by name.

**Scan text, not the typer.** This runs before typing; asking the typer for a module forces it to be
typed at the wrong moment.

---

## 3. Exposing your API to both engines

`Expose` is the counterpart to the bridge macro above: instead of generating subclassable
shells, it collects what your host offers scripts by name. Mark a type `@:scriptAmbient` or a static
`@:scriptStatic`, call `Expose.apply()` at startup, and it fills `Config.globalStatics` for
interpreted code and `Compiler.ambient`/`Compiler.statics` for compiled code from the same marks.
`globalStatics` rather than `globalVariables` on purpose: it records where the value lives rather
than the value, so a host reassigning the static is seen by both sides alike.

Worked through in
[`embedding.md`](embedding.md#giving-scripts-your-own-code), including why filling one side
only is a trap.

## 4. Adding a game library

**Read this only if the library you want is one hxScript does not already know.** lime, openfl,
flixel, flixel-addons, flixel-ui and heaps are shipped as presets: `-lib hxscript` beside `-lib
flixel` does all four steps below and there is nothing to write. `-D hxscript_verbose` prints what
was done, which is worth reading once.

The rest of this section is what those presets contain, and what to write for a library that has no
preset. A script that says `class Boss extends FlxSprite` needs four separate things to be true, and
each one fails differently:

| | step | symptom when missing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | the library's types are **in the build** | `Type not found`, or `import()` returns null |
| 2 | a **bridge** exists for each base scripts subclass | `Class <base> can't be extended for scripting` |
| 3 | its **abstracts** are wrapped | `Unknown identifier: ADD`, or an operator does nothing |
| 4 | methods with **no runtime form** are shimmed | `Cannot call null` |

All four are data, and the record is
[`hxscript.setup.Library`](../src/hxscript/setup/Library.hx):

```haxe
{
    define: 'mylib',              // the -lib define that switches it on
    title: 'my library',
    roots: ['mylib'],             // step 1, by including packages
    ignore: ['mylib.macros'],     // modules under those roots that are not runtime code
    types: [],                    // step 1, by referencing individual modules
    bases: ['mylib.Sprite'],      // step 2
    abstractPackages: ['mylib'],  // step 3, by scanning
    abstracts: [],                // step 3, by name
    abstractExclude: [],
    globals: ['mylib.Game']       // OFFERED as a bare name; Boot.importGlobals() takes it
}
```

Steps 1 to 3 are the whole of what a preset is for, and `globals` is not one of them: it is a name
pre-imported into the global scope of every script in the process, which shadows anything the host
binds under it. Every preset shipped here leaves it empty for that reason, and a script reaches those
libraries by writing its own `import`, as in Haxe. Fill it in your own record only if you are both the
library and the host and have decided the answer for yourself.

Hand it to [`Presets.custom`](../src/hxscript/setup/Presets.hx) from an init macro, and the rest
happens on its own:

```
--macro hxscript.setup.Presets.custom.push({define: 'mylib', ...})
```

Nothing in the record imports the library it describes, which is the point: these are strings, so
the same record is read by the macro that wires the build and by the code that runs at startup, and
the two halves cannot drift apart. A record whose `define` matches a shipped preset replaces it, so
overriding one of the presets is the same gesture as adding one.

**A record may also describe half of a library**, by naming a define nothing sets and saying what
really switches it on:

```haxe
{define: 'heaps3d', requires: 'heaps', ...}
```

That is how heaps ships as two: `heaps` is the 2D half, `heaps3d` is the scene graph, both arrive
with `-lib heaps`, and `-D hxscript_setup_skip=heaps3d` drops the second. It is worth doing wherever
one library holds two things a project picks between, because the halves are rarely the same size:
nine of the ten bridges the heaps presets generate are the 3D half, `h2d.Object` being the tenth, and
they are **about a megabyte of binary**, which a 2D project otherwise pays for a scene graph it never
builds into.

Nothing forces the split to be even. `h3d.Vector`, `h3d.Matrix` and `h3d.mat.Texture` stay in the 2D
record, because `h2d.Drawable` declares `colorAdd` and `colorMatrix` as the first two and `h2d.Tile`
is a region of the third. The cut follows what one half names, not what the packages are called.

The four subsections below are what each field means and how to work out its contents.

### Step 1: `include`, not `keep`

This is the one that wastes the most time, because the obvious flag is the wrong one.

- **`keep()` only adds `@:keep` metadata to types already being compiled.** It never pulls an
  unreferenced module into the build. Pointing it at a library your program does not otherwise touch
  does nothing at all, silently.
- **`include()` force-compiles *and* keeps every module** in a package.

Both were measured against the example's `game.Damage`, which nothing compiled references:
`--macro keep('game')` leaves it absent from the type table and a script fails with
`Type not found: game.Damage`; `--macro include('game')` puts it there and the script works.

Scripts reach library classes by name, reflectively, so DCE has no reason to keep anything the host
itself never references. `flixel.addons.effects.FlxSkewedSprite` resolves to null in a script for
exactly this reason until it is included.

```
--macro include('flixel', true, ['flixel.addons.nape', 'flixel.addons.editors.spine', 'flixel.system.macros'])
```

The second argument is recursive, and one recursive include covers a library and its addons when
they share a package root (flixel and flixel-addons both live under `flixel`, across classpaths).

**The ignore list is not optional.** Some modules cannot be compiled as ordinary runtime code and
will fail the build:

- **integrations for libraries you do not ship**, since `flixel.addons.nape` needs nape and
  `flixel.addons.editors.spine` needs spine;
- **macro-only classes**, because `flixel.system.macros` uses `haxe.macro.Context` and is meaningless at
  runtime;
- **deprecation stubs**, where `flixel.addons.tile.FlxRayCastTilemap` was removed in flixel-addons
  4.0.0 and what is left of the module is gated `#if (flixel < version("5.9.0"))`, so against flixel 6
  it declares no type at all and an include of it has nothing to compile.

Including a library wholesale costs binary size. That is the trade: a script can construct anything,
and the build carries everything.

### Step 2: bridge the bases scripts subclass

A list, as in §1. The flixel preset bridges `FlxBasic`, `FlxObject`, `FlxSprite`, `FlxState`,
`FlxSubState`, `flixel.group.FlxSpriteGroup` and `flixel.text.FlxText`, plus `FlxBackdrop` and
`FlxSkewedSprite` from flixel-addons and the three `FlxUI` states from flixel-ui. Add whichever of
your own states and game objects scripts build on; twenty or so entries covers a real game.

Keep it to what mods actually subclass. Every entry costs one generated override per inherited
non-inline, non-final method, and a display-object base has a lot of them.

A missing bridge fails in two stages, and only the first names the cause. The module's error hook
reports `Class <base> can't be extended for scripting`, but the type still appears in
`module.types`; instantiating it later throws `Type <name> is not initialized`, which does not
mention the base at all. Watch `onProgramError` during load rather than diagnosing from the
construction site.

**A constructor that cannot be rebuilt is no longer a base being refused.** A bridge used to rebuild
the base's constructor so a script's `new` could drive it, which meant re-typing a body the typer had
already lowered, and some lowered bodies can never be re-typed anywhere else: one naming a **private
type**, which the bridge is not allowed to name, one naming an **abstract's implementation class**,
whose members exist under no spelling reachable from outside, and one that **assigns to `this`**,
which an inlined abstract constructor does. Each of those used to fail the build.

Such a base is **constructed by Haxe** now. The bridge gets a real constructor calling a real `super`,
and the instance is allocated through it rather than emptily, so the base runs exactly as compiled and
nothing about it has to survive a round trip. What that costs is that the base's arguments have to be
known before the instance exists, which is why `ScriptedClass` evaluates the script's `super(...)`
arguments first and runs the rest of the constructor after. A base may also carry a shim,
`hxscript.shim.<its path, flattened>` with a static `init(instance, ...args)`, which becomes the body
of `__constructSuper` when one is there; nothing else about the bridge moves either way.

The practical consequence is that **the shape of a base's constructor is no longer a reason it cannot
be a base.** What still is: `final`, `extern`, an interface, and a `private` class. For a scanned
`@:scriptable` type those are filtered and reported under `-D hxscript_verbose`
(`not bridged: <path> (final)`); a base named in a `Library` record skips the filter, because naming
one is a decision already made.

Measured against the libraries the presets cover: `h2d.Object` bridges, `h2d.Drawable` and everything
under it does not, because `Drawable`'s surface mentions `h3d.Vector4` and a generated override of it
fails to compile inside `Vector4`'s own constructor. OpenFL's display objects **do** bridge, contrary
to what this page used to say. `DisplayObject` does mention types a generated override cannot name,
but those methods are skipped and left to `super`, which is the designed degradation. They are
expensive to bridge, because the cost is one override per inherited method and there are a great
many.

`flixel.ui.FlxButton` is still off the preset's bridge list, and it is worth knowing why the reason
changed. Its constructor does `new FlxButtonEvent(...)` against a class flixel declares `private`,
which is exactly the shape that used to fail the build. It no longer does, so the omission is now a
curated choice rather than a known impossibility: adding it is a build-and-see. Scripts construct
`FlxButton` either way, since it is in `globals` for any host that takes them.

Everything left out is still importable and constructible from a script. Only `extends` is off the
table, and the usual answer is a host class that *owns* one rather than *is* one.

Signatures are checked separately and more gently: a method whose parameters or return mention an
unnameable type is skipped and the native method stays in place, so one awkward method does not cost
you the base.

§1's "cost is per inherited method" is the other half of the same constraint.

### Step 3: wrap the abstracts scripts touch

§2's scanner, pointed at the library's packages. `flixel` is worth scanning wholesale, because
`FlxColor`, `FlxAxes`, `FlxTextAlign` and friends are exactly the things scripts hold.

**Do not scan openfl or lime.** They hold roughly four hundred abstracts between them, nearly all
platform plumbing no script will ever hold as a value, and every generated wrapper is a `@:keep`
class in the binary. Name the handful that matter:

```haxe
static final TYPES:Array<String> = [
	// `sprite.blend = BlendMode.ADD` is how any additive light, glow or flash is written.
	'openfl.display.BlendMode',
];
```

A scan makes the set implicit, so what a script can reach depends on what happens to be declared under
the scanned packages. Print it behind a define so it can be checked:

```haxe
Context.info('${wrapped.length} abstract(s) exposed to scripts', Context.currentPos());
if (Context.defined('scripted_abstracts_list'))
	for (path in wrapped) Context.info('  $path', Context.currentPos());
```

### Step 4: shim what has no runtime form

`inline` and `inline extern` members are invisible to scripts (§2). In a library this is not a thing
you control, and it changes under you between versions: flixel 6.2 turned `FlxG.sound.playMusic`
into an `inline extern` overload, and every script calling it started failing with `Cannot call null`
against code that had not changed.

This is the one step that cannot be data, because it is a closure that calls the library's own types.
So the closures live with the library they emulate, one package each:
[`hxscript.lib.stdlib.Shims`](../src/hxscript/lib/stdlib/Shims.hx) for the standard library,
[`hxscript.lib.flixel.Shims`](../src/hxscript/lib/flixel/Shims.hx) for the `playMusic` above,
[`hxscript.python.Shims`](../src/hxscript/python/Shims.hx) for the builtins that target implements as
statics, and [`hxscript.setup.Shims`](../src/hxscript/setup/Shims.hx) is the registrar that calls
each behind its own `#if`. A host adds its own to `Config.callShims` directly, per §5.
`-D hxscript_no_shims` turns the shipped ones off.

The failure is also self-describing now. `Cannot call StringBuf.addd` reports the receiver's type and
the member, and says whether the member is misspelled or has no runtime form:

```
Playground.hx:42: character 10
      return s.addd("x");
             ^
Cannot call StringBuf.addd
  `StringBuf` has no `addd`. Did you mean `add`?
```

### OpenFL specifics

Add `--macro allowPackage('flash')` if your build touches the `flash` package aliases.

### A library not covered here

Kha, or anything else, follows the same four steps and ends up as one `Library` record on
`Presets.custom`. Only three things are library-specific: what to ignore, what to bridge, and which
abstracts are worth wrapping. The package roots are the easy part, since Heaps is `h2d`, `h3d` and
`hxd`, and the three lists are not. Derive them:

1. `--macro include('<root>', true, [])` with an empty ignore list and build. Each failure names a
   module that cannot be compiled as runtime code. Add it and repeat. Expect macro-only packages and
   integrations for libraries you do not ship.
2. Add **one** bridge for the base you most want scriptable and build. If it fails, read which type
   the generated override could not name: that base is out, and its subclasses probably are too.
3. Scan the library's package for abstracts, build with the listing define on, and read what came
   out. If it is hundreds, stop scanning and name the few you need.
4. Write a script that touches the API you care about and run it. `Cannot call null` means an
   `inline` member and needs a shim; `Unknown identifier` means a missing wrap or include.

Steps 1 and 2 are compile-time and converge in a few builds. Steps 3 and 4 are the ones that keep
turning up later, which is why `-D hxscript_verbose` and a script that exercises the API are worth
having from the start.

One thing this recipe does not say, and the heaps preset found the hard way: **step 1 sometimes has
no answer.** `ignore` only removes a module from an include; it does nothing about a module that some
other module *references*, so a package holding one module that cannot compile may not be includable
at any ignore list. heaps 2.1.0 is that case, because `h2d.Flow` does not compile without domkit and enough
of `h2d` refers to it. The way out is to stop including the package and force the modules you want in
by **referencing** them instead, which is what `Library.types` is for. Note that an abstract cannot
be a reference *value*; it goes in a signature instead, which the setup handles.

---

## 5. A custom interpreter

`Config.interpClass` is the whole installation:

```haxe
Config.interpClass = ModInterp;
```

`Module` and `Script` build their interpreter from it **at construction**, so set it before any
script is loaded. Changing it later leaves already-built scripts on the old one.

The worked case is letting scripts name the members of some owning object directly, so a script
writes `log('...')` and `round` rather than `battle.log('...')` and `battle.round`. That is
[`../examples/battle/game/ModInterp.hx`](../examples/battle/game/ModInterp.hx). A game engine does the same thing
for the state or scene that created a script.

**Three methods are involved and missing any one leaves a hole.**

| override | covers | what breaks without it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `resolve` | reading a bare identifier | the whole feature |
| `setVar` | writing one | `round = 3` fails with `Unknown identifier: round`, so the field is readable but not writable from a script |
| `isResolvable` | the gate in front of `a.b` | the bare name works but `name.length` on it errors, because member access checks this and fails **without calling `resolve`** |

```haxe
@:access(hxscript.runtime.Interp)
class ModInterp extends Interp {
	override public function isResolvable(id:String):Bool {
		return super.isResolvable(id) || (context != null && fields.exists(id));
	}

	override public function resolve(id:String):Dynamic {
		if (imports.exists(id)) { ... }
		if (variables.exists(id))
			return resolveMirror(variables.get(id));
		if (context != null && fields.exists(id))
			return Reflect.getProperty(context, id);

		error(EUnknownVariable(id));
		return null;
	}

	override function setVar(name:String, v:Dynamic):Dynamic {
		if (!imports.exists(name) && !variables.exists(name) && context != null && fields.exists(name)) {
			Reflect.setProperty(context, name, v);
			return v;
		}
		return super.setVar(name, v);
	}
}
```

Two things to get right in the body:

**Hold the field names as a `Map`, not the `Array` `Type.getInstanceFields` returns.** This is
consulted for every identifier a script does not otherwise resolve *and* for the base of every
member access. A context object of any size makes that expensive: a game state with a few hundred
fields puts hundreds of string comparisons on a path that runs many times per frame.

**Stay additive.** Check `imports` and `variables` first so a script's own names still win, and defer
to `super` for everything you do not handle, so the strict undeclared-variable error still fires on a
typo. When the context is null the overrides collapse to base behaviour.

The example keeps the context static because it fights one battle at a time; a host with several
script owners at once keys it per interpreter instead, so each script resolves against its own.

---

## 6. Binding your API

There are five surfaces and they are not interchangeable. Picking the wrong one is the usual cause
of "the script cannot see it".

| surface | scope | holds | resolution order |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Config.globalImports` | every interpreter | **types**, by path | first |
| `Config.globalVariables` | every interpreter | values | after imports |
| `Environment.variables` | one world | values | after imports |
| `Script.variables` / `Module.variables` | one script | values | after imports |
| `Config.typeProxy` | every interpreter | a stand-in class for a type name | at resolution |

**Imports beat variables.** A global import of `File` shadows a variable named `File`, whatever you
set it to. If you bind a name like `File` to a guarded replacement, keep the real type out of the
global imports or the import wins and the guard is bypassed.

**All five reach compiled code**, and so do the `resolve`/`setVar` overrides above, since a compiled
module resolves a bare name through the interpreter that module already has. Nothing has to be
registered a second way for a script to keep its bytecode. What each one compiles to, and the two
knobs for the cases a bound value cannot decide, are in
[embedding.md](embedding.md).

**A global import that cannot resolve throws out of the `Script` constructor, uncaught.** Global
imports are applied on every interpreter reset, before your handlers exist. Guard the registration:

```haxe
for (path in GLOBALS)
	if (TypeCollection.main.fromPath(path) != null)
		Config.globalImports.set(path, INormal);
```

**Anything not registered is still reachable** by explicit `import`, resolved against every type
compiled into the program. Global imports are a convenience, not a permission system.

### `callShims`: methods with no runtime form

The same problem as `inline` abstract members, one level up. An `inline extern` method is inlined at
every compiled call site and has no method to reflect on, so a script gets `Cannot call null`.
Register a real closure keyed `<fully.qualified.Owner>.<method>`; the interpreter walks the
receiver's superclasses looking for one before failing:

```haxe
Config.callShims.set('flixel.system.frontEnds.SoundFrontEnd.playMusic',
	function(o:Dynamic, args:Array<Dynamic>):Dynamic {
		FlxG.sound.music = FlxG.sound.load(args[0], args[1], args[2]);
		FlxG.sound.music.play();
		return FlxG.sound.music;
	});
```

Flixel 6.2 turning `FlxG.sound.playMusic` into this form is the case that motivated it: a method that
was ordinary in 6.1 silently stopped existing for every script.

### `blacklist`: keeping scripts out

Four match kinds, in `Config.blacklist`:

```haxe
Config.blacklist.get(ByType).push('sys.io.Process');      // one exact type
Config.blacklist.get(ByModule).push('sys.io.File');       // every type in a module
Config.blacklist.get(ByPackage(false)).push('sys.io');    // that package only
Config.blacklist.get(ByPackage(true)).push('sys');        // and its sub-packages
```

**Use packaged names.** Blacklisting a top-level type works, but the default root wildcard import
tries to resolve it on every interpreter reset and logs a warning each time.

**`import` is a wider surface than name resolution**, and goes through the type collection. If you
gate resolution yourself as well, mirror the rules on both or they will disagree.

**Never blacklist `hxscript` itself.** Inside a script, `Std`, `Type` and `Reflect` resolve to
`hxscript.proxy.*` and scripted abstracts run on `hxscript.types.*`, so blocking the package
blacklists the interpreter's own machinery and every script using `Std` dies with
`Unknown identifier: Std`. Block `hxscript.Config` by exact type instead.

### The rest of `Config`

| field | default | what it is for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `interpClass` | `Interp` | the interpreter subclass to instantiate |
| `typedMode` | on (`-D hxscript_dynamic` flips it) | enforce declared types at runtime |
| `strictAccess` | `false` | enforce `private` on script-declared members. Not the only gate: the check runs when this **or** `typedMode` is set, and `typedMode` defaults on, so `private` is enforced out of the box. Only explicit `private` counts; unmarked members stay public, unlike Haxe, because existing scripts rely on it. `@:privateAccess` waives it at the call site |
| `preprocessorValues` | host defines + `hxscript` | what `#if` in a script sees |
| `typeProxy` | `Std`, `Type`, `Reflect`, and `Math` on hl and python | swap a type name for a stand-in class |
| `globalVariables` | `null`/`true`/`false`, `Int`/`Float`/`Bool` tokens | values in every interpreter |

---

## Order of operations

Config is process-wide and read at construction, so sequence matters. Steps 1 and 3 happen on their
own, because `extraParams.hxml` runs the setup macro, and `Environment`, `Module` and `Script` each call
`hxscript.setup.Boot.ensure()` before doing anything else, so the runtime half is in place before the
first interpreter exists whichever of the three you reach for first. What is left is what a host adds
on top:

1. **Init macros**, at compile time: bridge generation, abstract metadata, and the includes that put
   both in the build. *(automatic)*
2. **`Config.interpClass`**, before any `Script` or `Module` exists.
3. **`Config.globalImports`, `blacklist`, `callShims`, `strictAccess`**, before the first script is
   constructed. Global imports are applied on every interpreter reset. *(automatic for anything a
   preset or `@:scriptAmbient` covers; a host's own additions go here)*
4. **Build the `Environment`**, add modules, set world variables.
5. **`environment.start()`**.

Anything a host adds at step 2 or 3 has to be added before its first `Module`, for the same reason
the ordering exists at all: a module builds its interpreter in its constructor. Calling
`Boot.ensure()` yourself first, explicitly, is a fine way to be sure of the order.

[`../examples/battle/game/Mods.hx`](../examples/battle/game/Mods.hx) is this list as code, in order, and is short.

## Where to go next

- [embedding.md](embedding.md) is the ground floor: running scripts, exposing types, errors,
  bridges by hand.
- [parity.md](parity.md) is what scripts can and cannot do compared to real Haxe.
- [../examples/battle/](../examples/battle) is all of it, runnable.
- [../apps/sandbox/](../apps/sandbox) is section 4 in use: an application whose projects are scripts
  run against lime, openfl and flixel.
